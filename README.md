## Features

- üè¶ Simulates investment growth over time.
- üìà Calculates future value based on user input.
- üéØ Allows users to set investment goals.
- üí° Interactive terminal-based gameplay.

## How It Works

In this game, players start with an initial investment and specify the nominal interest rate and investment duration. The game calculates how much the investment will grow and whether it meets the player's goals.

## Math Behind the Game

The game uses the following financial formulas:

1. **Future Value (FV)**:
   \[
   FV = P \times (1 + r/n)^{nt}
   \]
   Where:
   - \( P \) = Principal amount (initial investment)
   - \( r \) = Nominal annual interest rate (as a decimal)
   - \( n \) = Number of compounding periods per year
   - \( t \) = Number of years

2. **Effective Annual Rate (EAR)** (if needed for further extensions):
   \[
   EAR = (1 + r/n)^{n} - 1
   \]
   This formula helps in understanding the real return on an investment, considering the effect of compounding.

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/rkstudio585/investment-challenge.git
